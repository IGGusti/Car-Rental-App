# Car Rental App

Big Project

A Desktop Application in Visual Basic. In this application users can easily process all data with a new information system, from car data, inventory, rental packages, costs, customers, to transaction data. So that the operator easily searches for information needed.
The use of book rental and return lists is not needed, because with the new information system, users only need to input leasing data and return data and this application can print out the data directly, so that the time needed to make all the reports is very efficient.
Users can find out the latest information directly, if when the transaction returns it turns out the customer is experiencing a delay in return. Because the system can automatically calculate how long the delay is and how much fines must be paid by the customer.

Requirements:
- tkiso-vsultimate2010.iso
- Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 (SQLFULL_x64_ENU.exe)
- Setting table on database
